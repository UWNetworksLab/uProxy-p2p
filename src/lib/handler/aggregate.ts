// The |Aggregator| interface aggregates objects of type |T| to form a
// compound object of type |T2|. It may have internal data, including time
// which it uses as part of the aggregation. The |input| function adds a new
// input, and the |check| function returns an optional aggregated output. If
// the time/aggregate is not ready yet, |check| returns |null|. (Typically,
// calling |check| twice without an |input| in between will result in the null
// the second time; although this is not strictly enforced it is recommended).
