// This file defines 'handler queues'. These are an abstraction for a stream of
// events (but think of an event as an element of data to be handled) along with
// a stream of functions to handle the events. Each event is guarenteed to be
// handled, and gets a promise for the result of that event being handled. A
// function handling an event may set the function that handles future events,
// or it may stop handling events in which case the event stream will be queued
// until a handler is set.
//
// This is a bit like traditional event handlers, but each thing in the hanlder
// queue must be handled by exactly one handler (although that handler may
// itself call several functions). This allows async assignment of the handler
// along with asynchronous adding of events to the queue.
//
// CONSIDER: How efficient is a new Error? Maybe best to have rejection
// without an error since the error is not meaningful.
//
// CONSIDER: there's quite a bit of book-keeping for the resulting promises from
// a handle call. We may want a simpler version of this class that doesn't need
// to remember result values (those of type Result).
//
// CONSIDER: This is kind of similar to functional parsing. May be good to
// formalize the relationship in comments here.
