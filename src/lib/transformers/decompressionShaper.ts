// A transformer that uses an arithmetic coder to change the entropy.
// This transformer uses a somewhat unusual technique of reverse compression.
// The only instance I know of this being done previously is in Dust:
// http://github.com/blanu/Dust
//
// Dust uses the reverse Huffman encoding describe in the book "Disappearing
// Cryptography" by Peter Wayner. Chapter 6.2 (p. 88) describes the technique
// as follows:
// "This chapter is about creating an automatic way of taking small, innocuous
// bits of data and embellishing them with deep, embroidered details until the
// result mimics something completely different. The data is hidden as it
// assumes this costume. The effect is accomplished here by running the Huffman
// compression algorithm described in Chapter 5 in reverse. Ordinarily, the
// Huffman algorithm would aprrxoimate the statistical distribution of the text
// and then convert it into a digital shorthand. Running this in reverse can
// take normal data and form it into elaborate patterns."
//
// Dust uses a Huffman encoder, and statistical tests run on the results have
// shown that Huffman encoding has a limitation when used in this way. The
// probabilities of bytes can only be based on powers of two (1/2, 1/4, etc.).
// This limits its facility at mimicry if the mimicked distribution differs
// greatly from an approximation which is quantized into powers of two.
// Therefore, an arithmetic encoder is used here instead of a Huffman encoder.
// As far as I know, this is the first time this has been done, so the results
// compared to Huffman encoding are unknown.
//
// The important thing to realize is that the compression algorithm is being
// run in reverse, contrary to normal expectations.
