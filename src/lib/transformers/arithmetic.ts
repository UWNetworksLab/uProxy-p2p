//
// At any point during arithmetic coding the output consists of four parts:
// 1. The part already written into the output buffer and does not change.
// 2. One digit that may be changed by at most one carry when adding to the
//    lower end of the interval. There will never be two carries. since the
//    range when fixing that digit was <= 1 unit. Two carries would require
//    range > 1 unit.
// 3. There is a (possibly empty) block of digits that pass on a carry. (255 for
//    bytes) that are represented by a counter counting their number.
// 4. The last part is represented by the low end range variable of the encoder.
