    "message": "uProxy only proxies traffic for the web browser it is running in, not for other applications, like email programs. There are some uncommon situations where the browser might make unproxied requests, and some web technologies, notably Flash and WebRTC, are capable of making requests that don't go through the proxy. Similar information leakage can occur with many popular VPNs, and users with strong privacy needs are encouraged to consider the Tor Browser, which is engineered specifically to avoid revealing information to observers."

In addition, if you choose to connect uProxy to Facebook or Google, your friends on that network (Facebook friends or Google Hangouts contacts) who are also using uProxy will be able to see that you've logged on.</p>If you connect uProxy to a social network, that company is able to tell that you're running uProxy. In addition, using uProxy with Google and Facebook relies partly on Firebase, a service operated by Google, so Google and the uProxy team (which administers the uProxy Firebase account) have access to information about which accounts are using uProxy.</p><p>Users who are concerned about using uProxy with their personal accounts may wish to consider creating a dedicated pseudonymous account."

    "description": "",
    "message": "When you install uProxy on Chrome, it asks for permission to (1) read and change all your data on the websites you visit, and (2) Communicate with cooperating websites. These permissions are necessary for uProxy to route your traffic through your friend's computer. No data about the websites you visit is ever sent to the uProxy team or the social networks you connect to."

  },
  "WHAT_IS_PORT_CONTROL_ANSWER": {
    "description": "",
    "message": "Network Address Translation (NAT) is typically implemented by routers to allow a single IP address to be shared by multiple computers. However, this can make it challenging for users to establish direct connections with each other, and some types of NATs (particularly symmetric NATs) can prevent uProxy from successfully establishing connections.</p><p>If your router has port control enabled (UPnP, NAT-PMP, or PCP), uProxy can instruct your router to specifically allow incoming connections from other uProxy users. If either side of a uProxy connection is able to use port control, connections will almost always be successful, regardless of NAT configuration. To learn how to enable port control on your router, check your router manual or Google \"your router name\" + \"enable UPnP\"."

  "HOW_DOES_UPROXY_COMPARE_ANSWER": {
    "description": "",
    "message": "uProxy is designed to be trustworthy and resistant to blocking. VPN users typically connect to a shared pool of servers that can be identified and blocked. However, uProxy users connect to each other, rather than to common servers, and we conceal the nature of those connections, to make them hard to identify. Also, just like ISPs, VPN services can monitor which websites you visit, and it's often impossible to know what they do with that data. uProxy users only have to trust their friends, not VPN services they don't know. We also try to minimize the trust you have to place in the uProxy team, by open sourcing our code and encouraging external review."
