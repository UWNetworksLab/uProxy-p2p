    "message": "<p>When you use the Internet normally, your Internet service provider (ISP) is able to see which sites you’re visiting, and may try to interfere with your connection by blocking access to some sites, or even tampering with their content. On Wi-Fi networks that don’t require a password, it’s even possible for another user on the network to see which sites you’re visiting, and for sites that are HTTP (and not HTTPS), it’s possible they can see the content of the traffic, too.</p><p>When you’re getting access through uProxy, the connection between you and your friend is encrypted. Your browser’s traffic is sent through that connection, and then out to the Internet from your friend’s computer. While getting access through uProxy, your ISP should not be able to see what sites you’re visiting, and uProxy intentionally makes it difficult for your ISP to identify and block your uProxy traffic.</p>"

    "message": "<p>uProxy is designed to help friends who trust one another to share an Internet connection. Connecting to people you don’t trust is risky and not recommended.</p><p>If you get access from someone who is malicious, they may be able to spy on your web browsing and even tamper with your traffic. Besides trusting the person you’re getting access from, you should trust that their Internet connection is secure, too. So if they’re connecting from an unknown public Wi-Fi hotspot that may be insecure, it may be better to wait till they’re connected from a secure network back at home.</p><p>If you share access with someone you don’t know and trust, they may be able to use your connection to engage in illegal activity, and depending on local laws, you may be held legally responsible for facilitating that activity.<p>It’s important to trust anyone you share an Internet connection with, whether a guest on your home Wi-Fi network, or a uProxy friend on the other side of the world.</p>"

    "message": "<p>uProxy is not an anonymity tool; it is useful for concealing your browsing from your ISP, but not for hiding your identity from the sites you visit. A website visited by someone who is getting access via uProxy will see the IP address of the person who is sharing access, and the website may be able to discover the IP address of the uProxy user who is getting access.

  "WHAT_ISNT_PROXIED_ANSWER": {

    "message": "<p>uProxy only proxies traffic for the web browser it is running in, not for other applications. There are some uncommon situations where the browser might make unproxied requests, and some web technologies, notably Flash and WebRTC, are capable of making requests that don’t go through the proxy. The same caveats often apply to VPNs. Users with strong privacy needs are encouraged to consider the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html\">Tor Browser</a>, which is designed specifically to minimize what an observer of your traffic can learn about your activity.</p>"

The Firebase team, and the uProxy team which administers the uProxy Firebase account, can therefore access information about which accounts are using uProxy.</p><p>If you are concerned about using uProxy with your personal account, create a dedicated pseudonymous account and use that with uProxy instead.</p><p>Note that none of these services ever see what sites or pages you’re visiting while using uProxy.

    "description": "",
    "message": "<p>Network Address Translation (NAT) is typically implemented by routers to allow a single public IP address to be shared by multiple devices on the network. However, this can make it challenging for users to establish direct connections with each other, and some types of NATs (particularly symmetric NATs) can prevent uProxy from successfully establishing connections.</p><p>If your router has port control enabled (UPnP, NAT-PMP, or PCP), uProxy can instruct your router to specifically allow incoming connections from other uProxy users. If either side of a uProxy connection is able to use port control, connections will almost always be successful, regardless of NAT configuration. For information on enabling port control on your router, check your router’s manual or search the web for “(router name) enable UPnP”.</p>"

    "message": "<p>uProxy is designed to be trustworthy and resistant to blocking.</p><p>VPN users typically connect to easily-identified servers, and VPN traffic can easily be identified and blocked. In contrast, uProxy users connect to each other rather than to common servers, and uProxy makes its traffic hard to identify and therefore hard to block.</p><p>In addition, VPN services can monitor which websites you visit, and many don’t keep this data private. uProxy users place their trust in their connections through friends, rather than in VPN services they may know little about.</p><p>Besides not knowing what VPNs do with their users’ browsing data, it can also be hard to know and trust VPN client and server software, especially when it’s closed source. In contrast, uProxy is open source, and faces ongoing public scrutiny. Whenever possible, uProxy avoids requiring users to put blind faith in software whose trustworthiness cannot be verified.</p>"
