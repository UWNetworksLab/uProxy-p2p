# Our modified build of Crosswalk includes support for obfuscating WebRTC output
# in native code.  This is how we implement obfuscation on Android, where we
# have the ability to provide our own modified browser runtime and the CPU is
# not fast enough for our implementation of CHURN in javascript to perform well.
